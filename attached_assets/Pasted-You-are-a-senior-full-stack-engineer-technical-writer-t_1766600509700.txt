You are a senior full-stack engineer + technical writer tasked with building a high-end personal portfolio website for a Systems & Networking Engineer.
This is not a resume website. It must read like an engineering portfolio + technical case study hub suitable for recruiters and deep-tech startups.

1. PROFESSIONAL POSITIONING (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Title / Identity

Systems & Networking Engineer

Target Audience

Recruiters and deep-tech startups (infra, networking, distributed systems, ML systems)

Core Domains

Distributed Systems

Computer Networks

OS Internals

ML Systems (applied to networking)

This positioning must be explicit on the landing section.

2. TECHNICAL PRIORITY HIERARCHY (VERY IMPORTANT)

Structure the site to clearly reflect depth, not breadth.

Primary Focus (Most Prominent)

C / C++

Networking protocols

OS internals

ns-3 simulations

xv6 kernel work

Distributed systems design

Secondary Focus (Strong but Supporting)

Blockchain infrastructure

Lens Protocol

Aave

Arbitrage bots

DeFi systems engineering

Tertiary Focus (Support Role Only)

Frontend engineering (Next.js, React)

Clearly framed as tooling to support systems, not the core skill

3. PROJECTS SECTION — CASE STUDY STYLE (MANDATORY)
Source of Projects

I am providing my CV — extract all major projects from it.

I am also providing extensive Arista / Inter-IIT technical reports and design documents.

You must merge and distill these into clear, readable, but technically deep case studies.

REQUIRED FORMAT FOR EACH PROJECT

Each project must have:

1. One-line problem statement
2. System architecture overview (textual, with diagram placeholders)
3. My role and ownership
4. Technical depth section
5. Outcomes / validation / metrics (if applicable)
6. Technologies used

Avoid resume bullet points. Write like a technical design document summary.

ARISTA / INTER-IIT PROJECT (FLAGSHIP)

Create a flagship multi-section case study for the Arista / Inter-IIT work, covering:

Client-Centric WiFi RRM problem

Multi-timescale control loops (fast / slow / event)

ns-3 simulation framework

GNN as a digital twin

Safe reinforcement learning (CQL, offline → online)

Causal inference (DiD-based reward validation)

End-to-end architecture

This should be the deepest project on the site, with expandable sections.

Include:

Architecture diagram placeholders

Pipeline flow placeholders

Metrics/graphs placeholders

Links placeholders for reports

4. ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY SECTION (IMPORTANT)

Add a dedicated section explaining how I think as an engineer, including:

Preference for correctness, observability, and predictable failure modes

Comfort with low-level systems and abstractions

Trade-off driven design (performance vs safety vs scalability)

Why simulation, validation, and safety matter in production systems

Tone: technical, confident, not marketing fluff.

5. SITE STRUCTURE (EXPECTED SECTIONS)

Minimum required sections:

Landing / Hero

About (technical orientation, not personal story)

Engineering Philosophy

Projects (case-study driven)

Skills (structured by domain, not buzzwords)

Publications / Reports / Technical Docs (placeholders allowed)

Resume download

Contact (email + optional form)

6. DESIGN & UX REQUIREMENTS

Theme

Dark

Minimal

Technical / research-oriented aesthetic

Animations

Subtle, purposeful (section transitions, hover reveals)

No flashy gimmicks

UX Principles

Content-first

Readable typography

Clear hierarchy

Responsive across devices

7. TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS

Use a modern, production-grade stack, preferably:

Next.js

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS (or equivalent)

Code must be:

Modular

Well-structured

Easy to extend (blog, more projects later)

8. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Fully responsive

SEO-ready

Resume download button

Clean contact section

Analytics-ready (placeholder ok)

Fast load times

9. OUTPUT EXPECTATION

You must:

Generate the entire website code

Explain the project structure

Clearly comment where content is derived from CV vs Arista reports

Leave explicit placeholders where diagrams / PDFs will be linked

This site should feel appropriate for:

Infrastructure startups

Networking companies

Research-oriented engineering teams

Do not simplify the content. Assume a technically literate audience.

FINAL INSTRUCTION

Build this as if it represents a top-1% systems engineer portfolio, not a generic student website.
